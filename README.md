## About The project
Using a fabric to sense the touch is now possible with the E256 eTextile matrix sensor.
The E256 is a development kit for designers, makers and companies who want to combine textile and programing into new eTextile projects. From the beginning this project stimulates the development of technologies in artistic use cases: playing music, combine graphics and sound, creating textile furniture that can have tactile properties, etc, etc.

This kit features 30cm by 30cm sensitive textile that allow multi touch sensing and pressures topographic analysis.
This textile sensor can be connected to any microcontrollers with ADC capabilities.
The electronic hardware and all the software are fully open source.
The demo codes are available for Arduino and Teensy MCUs.
We will soon release a BLE demo to interface this textile matrix sensor with any mobile devices.
Made out of conductive textile shaped in rows and columns and a layer of piezoresistive fabric, this textile sensor is designed to be easy to make.
The demo software perform a real time 3D visualization of all pressure applied onto the fabric sensor.
This software is polling OSC messages from the Teensy
OSC messages can be used in audio application such as PureData, SuperCollider, etc.
