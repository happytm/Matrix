## About The project
Using a fabric to sense the touch is now possible with the eTextile matrix sensor.
The eTextile matrix sensor is a development kit for designers, makers and companies who want to combine textile and programing into new eTextile projects.
This kit features 30cm by 30cm sensitive textile that allow multi touch sensing and pressures topographic analysis.
This textile sensor can be connected to any microcontrollers with ADC capabilities.
The electronic hardware and all the software are fully open source.
The demo codes are available for Arduino and Teensy MCUs.
We will soon release a BLE demo to interface this textile matrix sensor with any mobile devices.
Made out of conductive textile shaped in rows and columns and a layer of piezoresistive fabric, this textile sensor is designed to be easy to make.
The demo software perform a real time 3D visualization of all pressure applied onto the fabric sensor.
This software analyses the touch to trigger OSC messages that can be used in audio application such as PureData, SuperCollider, etc.
From the beginning this project stimulates the development of technologies in artistic use cases: playing music, combine graphics and sound, imagine objects that can have tactile properties, etc.

## Kit Ordering
If you want a sensor just drop me an eMail at contact@eTextile.org
I make all sensors bay hand. It take one or two days to make it and send it by post.
All sensors are tested before shipping.
If you have any mistake I will help you to fix it or replace it.
