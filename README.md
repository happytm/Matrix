## About The project
Using a fabric to sense the touch is now possible with the E256 eTextile matrix sensor.
The E256 is a development kit for designers, makers and companies who want to combine textile and programing into new eTextile projects. From the beginning this project stimulates the development of technologies in artistic use cases: playing music, combine graphics and sound, creating textile furniture that can have tactile properties, etc, etc.

This kit features 30cm by 30cm sensitive textile that allow multi-touch sensing and pressures topographic analysis.
The software, frmware and hardware are distributed under Creative Commons license (Cf: LICENSE.txt). The E256 firmware is made with Arduino IDE. BLE hardware is the next step to interface the E256-textile with mobile devices. Made out of conductive textile shaped in rows and columns and a layer of piezoresistive fabric, the E256-textile sensor is designed to be easy to make.
